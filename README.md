# Usage
## mix law.new
Command `mix law.new` generates new Elixir project. Compatible with all standard `mix new` task options, arguments and flags. Benefits:
- `Credo` static code analysis tool will make your code pretty and consistent. Can be configured with `.coverex_ignore.exs` file.
- `Coverex` tool will help you to check test coverage for each module of new project. Can be configured with `.coverex_ignore.exs` file.
- `Dialyzer` is static analysis tool for BEAM bytecode. Most useful feature of this tool is perfect type inference what will work in your project from-the-box without writing any explicit function specs or any other overhead. Can be configured with `.dialyzer_ignore` file.
- `Xref` built-in ( in modern elixir compilers ) cross-reference tool. Your code will be checked for calls of undefined functions.
- Auto-generated git `pre-commit` hook will not let you make commits before all issues generated by compiler and static analysis tools will be fixed and all tests will pass. Can be configured with `pre-commit` file.

## mix law.keep
Command `mix law.keep` compiles project and executes all possible checks.
